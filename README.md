# Cookie Policy Proposal

Since the inception of the GDPR in 2018 a lot of things have changed in the realms of the internet.
Most notably we all keep accepting cookies everywhere, all the time.
Don't get me wrong.
I love the effort to protect user data and privacy.
But I do think, letting websites get away with mass data collection by simply putting up an obscure consent form is far from optimal.

The average non-technical internet user does not understand the implications.
What is a cookie?
A delicious treat.
I keep accepting them on every website, yet not a single one of them have sent any cookies.

This proof-of-concept proposes a new extension to the law, wherein if you collect, store and/or process personal idenfifiable data, you must in exchange send your users cookies.
Freshly baked delicious cookies.

If you track your users and learn things about them like their address, tastes and preferences you should be required by law, to use this knowledge for good.
